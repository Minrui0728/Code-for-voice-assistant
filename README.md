# Code-for-voice-assistant

Mindeating is a voice assistant application that was implemented using Google Actions. It will guide
them to go through a mindful eating exercise step by step to lead the user to engage their five sense
such as sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.
In order to investigate how different roles affect the encouragement of mindful eating, there
fore we design two versions of the application with different conversation styles. A counselor version and a friend version.
The counselor version has a formal conversational tone, using formal, and professional words with a more specific recommendation and guidance.

The friend version has  a casual conversational tone, using words that are commonly used in daily conversations, and asking more questions rather than just giving a specific recommendation. In addition, the friend version provides less guidance than the counselor version
